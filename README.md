# Human-Resources-Analysis

Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Have fun with this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Fields in the dataset include:
Satisfaction Level Last evaluation Number of projects Average monthly hours Time spent at the company Whether they have had a work accident Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years Departments (column sales) Salary Whether the employee has left

## Relationships I want to analyze

<ol><li>Satisfaction level vs average monthly hours</li>
<li>Department with highest turnover</li>
<li>last evaluation vs satisfaction level</li></ol>
<li style = "text-decoration: underline;">Deeper analysis of regretted attrition:</li>
<li style = "margin-left: 100px";>Did they have a recent promotion</li>
<li style = "margin-left: 100px";>Did they spend too much time at work</li>
<li style = "margin-left: 100px";>Work accident</li>
<li style = "margin-left: 100px";>Number of projects</li>
<li style = "margin-left: 100px";>Last evaluations</li>
